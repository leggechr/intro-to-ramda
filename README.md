# Introduction to Ramda

Ramda is a practical functional library for JavaScript programmers. It enables us to write clean, concise, functional code and it integrates well into React/Redux based applications

See my presentation slides [here](https://github.com/leggechr/intro-to-ramda/blob/master/files/Intro%20to%20Ramda.pdf). 

These are some resources I found very helpful when learning about functional programming and Ramda:

- [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)
- [Ramda homepage](http://ramdajs.com/0.22.1/index.html#)
- [Ramda documentation](http://ramdajs.com/0.22.1/docs/)
- [What Ramda function should I use?](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use%3F)
